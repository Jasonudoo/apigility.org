We still recommend **5.4.8** for serving the admin user interface.\r\n\r\n- New modules, [zf-apigility-documentation](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation) and\r\n  [zf-apigility-documentation-swagger](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation-swagger),\r\n  providing documentation visualizations of APIs created with Apigility. The\r\n  base module provides both JSON and HTML visualizations via the URI\r\n  `/apigility/documentation`, based on the Accept header value present.\r\n  zf-apigility-documentation-swagger provides an additional JSON visualization\r\n  for the mediatype `application/vnd.swagger+json`, for seeding a [Swagger\r\n  UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) installation; additionally, it\r\n  provides the Swagger UI via `/apigility/swagger`.\r\n\r\n  zf-apigility-documentation is enabled by default in zf-apigility-skeleton;\r\n  zf-apigility-documentation-swagger is an opt-in module.\r\n\r\n- **The `/admin` and `/welcome` routes are now removed!** The admin UI now uses\r\n  `/apigility/ui`, and the welcome screen uses `/apigility/welcome`. New routes\r\n  for documentation are also available, as detailed above.\r\n\r\n- A new module was created for Apigility-specific interfaces,\r\n  [zf-apigility-provider](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-provider).\r\n  The primary use case is for composition in modules that may or may not be\r\n  consumed by Apigility (e.g., a general-purpose module that could be composed\r\n  into many projects). The only interface currently is\r\n  `ZF\\Apigility\\Provider\\ApigilityProviderInterface`, which replaces\r\n  `Zend\\Apigility\\ApigilityModuleInterface` (and thus prevents the necessity of\r\n  installing all Apigility modules just to implement the interface!).\r\n\r\n- A new module was introduced for handling development mode, \r\n  [zf-development-mode](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-development-mode);\r\n  this is a fork of [NFDevelopmentMode](https://github.com/19ft/NFDevelopmentMode),\r\n  which was based off the equivalent functionality in zf-apigility-skeleton's\r\n  `Application` module. We removed the functionality from the skeleton, and\r\n  added a dependency on the new module.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility-skeleton's layout was updated to match that of the admin UI.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility-admin received numerous updates:\r\n    - Ability to add documentation of services, fields, and operations.\r\n\r\n    - Ability to use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) when configuring an\r\n      OAuth2 authentication adapter.\r\n\r\n    - Ability to inspect, add, configure, and delete zf-content-negotiation\r\n      selectors.\r\n\r\n    - Links to HTML documentation of APIs managed by the Apigility instance\r\n      (more on this below).\r\n\r\n    - Ability to create and manipulate filter chains for each field in a\r\n      service.\r\n\r\n    - (Limited) detection of whether or not an opcode cache is enabled; if\r\n      detected, a modal dialog will be presented to the end-user detailing how\r\n      to disable it.\r\n\r\n    - Completely overhauled and refactored admin UI application to ease\r\n      maintenance and feature additions. The admin UI now uses\r\n      [Bower](http://bower.io) for managing UI asset dependencies, and\r\n      [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for building the UI distribution. We have\r\n      dropped ng-route for the [angular-ui\r\n      ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router), providing us with\r\n      more flexibility in UI implementation and layout. All services,\r\n      controllers, and directives have been moved into their own files.\r\n\r\n    - Countless UI/UX improvements.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility-welcome has been updated to use the Apigility \"Rocket ElePHPant\"\r\n  logo for the splash screen, and to provide buttons to the HTML and Swagger\r\n  documentation, if the appropriate modules are available.\r\n\r\n- **zf-rest and zf-rpc now each store a `service_name` key in the configuration\r\n  for each service.** While efforts have been made to ensure existing\r\n  configuration still works, we recommend adding this key to each service. The\r\n  value should be the short name representation for the service, usually the\r\n  name you provided when creating the service.\r\n\r\n- **All repositories have been updated to make a clean distinction between the\r\n  terms \"Entity\", \"Collection\", and \"Resource\".** An \"Entity\" is anything\r\n  addressable via a URI containing a unique identifier. A \"Collection\" is any\r\n  URI that returns a set of entities. A \"Resource\" refers to a URI that may\r\n  return collections and/or entities. As such, we have several BC breaks:\r\n\r\n    - The event `renderResource` is now `renderEntity`.\r\n\r\n    - The event `renderCollection.resource` is now `renderCollection.entity`.\r\n\r\n    - `ZF\\Hal\\Resource` was renamed to `ZF\\Hal\\Entity`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource` in the zf-mvc-auth configuration is now `entity`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource_http_methods` in zf-rest is now\r\n      `entity_http_methods`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource_class` in zf-rest is now `entity_class`.\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `resource_identifier_name` in zf-rest is now\r\n      `entity_identifier_name`. (This change only affects those who have been\r\n      using latest master, but have not updated since late-January 2014.)\r\n\r\n    - The subkey `identifier_name` in zf-apigility `db-connected` configuration\r\n      is now `entity_identifier_name`;\r\n\r\n- zf-hal now properly differentiates between the identifier used in the route\r\n  definition, and the identifier used for the entity; this allows you to use one\r\n  value on the uri -- e.g., `status_id` -- and another in your entity class --\r\n  e.g., `id`. zf-hal will fallback to the `route_identifier_name` if no\r\n  `entity_identifier_name` is present.\r\n\r\n- zf-apigility, when detecting an input filter is present, will pull values from\r\n  the input filter, and not use any other values even if provided in the\r\n  request. This prevents SQL errors due to unknown columns.\r\n\r\n  Additionally, zf-apigility's assets were updated, and a Grunt + Bower\r\n  toolchain provided for keeping them up-to-date.\r\n\r\n- zf-rest, when detecting an input filter is present for the current request,\r\n  will inject it into the `ResourceEvent`, allowing developers to retrieve it\r\n  via `$this->getEvent()->getInputFilter()`. \r\n\r\n  Additionally, support for `patchList` was added to the\r\n  `AbstractResourceListener`.\r\n\r\n- zf-api-problem was updated to match [Problem\r\n  API draft 5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-05).\r\n  This has changed the internal structure and JSON representation of problem\r\n  results. If you were manipulating `ApiProblem` objects directly previously,\r\n  you may need to alter your code.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/128739","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/128739/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/128739/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/0.8.0","id":128739,"tag_name":"0.8.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.8.0","draft":false,"author":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbe5dfeb671c12d7520445b9292e10d13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2013-12-20T21:30:20Z","published_at":"2013-12-20T21:52:05Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/51453","id":51453,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.tgz","label":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.tgz","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbe5dfeb671c12d7520445b9292e10d13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-compressed-tar","state":"uploaded","size":97823152,"download_count":192,"created_at":"2013-12-20T21:44:20Z","updated_at":"2013-12-20T21:52:05Z"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/51454","id":51454,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.zip","label":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.8.0.zip","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbe5dfeb671c12d7520445b9292e10d13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":103633178,"download_count":1816,"created_at":"2013-12-20T21:48:43Z","updated_at":"2013-12-20T21:52:05Z"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/tarball/0.8.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/zipball/0.8.0","body":"Adds

For requests with content, if the matched\r\n  controller has an associated input filter, the data is passed to the input\r\n  filter, and an error is returned on validation failure.\r\n  - 422 responses are returned when validation fails.\r\n  - 400 responses are returned when the content contains unrecognized data.\r\n- Admin UI now adds an \"Inputs\" tab to each service, allowing the user to create\r\n  and edit inputs for the service, as well as associate validators.\r\n- Hydrators are now specified via a dropdown, populated from a list of known\r\n  hydrator services in the application.\r\n  - The ArraySerializable hydrator is now specified as the default hydrator for\r\n    REST entity objects.\r\n- The AbstractResourceListener now correctly pulls any whitelisted query string\r\n  variables and passes them to the `fetchAll()` method.\r\n- You may now specify the default version to use when no version is specified\r\n  (previously, hard-coded to use version 1 as the default version).\r\n- The Admin API will now report an error if you attempt to create a new API and\r\n  a matching module name already exists.\r\n- All Apigility modules now use \"next significant release\" notation in their\r\n  composer.json files to ensure the latest stable version **or** development\r\n  version will be selected (vs only the latest development version).\r\n- All Apigility modules have been updated to ensure they are compatible with\r\n  Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests.\r\n- Tables used with DB-Connected REST resources can now contain underscores in\r\n  their names.\r\n- Content negotiation now detects JSON decoding errors and raises an exception\r\n  when detected.\r\n- Composed ZF\\Hal\\Link\\Link properties in objects rendered as HAl will be\r\n  rendered as relational links.\r\n- The collection name of a HAL collection can now be specified in HAL metadata\r\n  configuration.\r\n- OAuth2 support has been improved to allow better integration between ZF2 and\r\n  oauth2-server-php request objects, and to allow the password grant type.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/95034","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/95034/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/95034/assets{?name}","html_url":"https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/tag/0.7.0","id":95034,"tag_name":"0.7.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"0.7.0","draft":false,"author":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbe5dfeb671c12d7520445b9292e10d13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":true,"created_at":"2013-11-15T20:22:54Z","published_at":"2013-11-15T22:58:12Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/37949","id":37949,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.7.0.tgz","label":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.7.0.tgz","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbe5dfeb671c12d7520445b9292e10d13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-compressed-tar","state":"uploaded","size":99013178,"download_count":33,"created_at":"2013-11-15T22:51:09Z","updated_at":"2013-11-15T22:58:12Z"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/assets/37950","id":37950,"name":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.7.0.zip","label":"zf-apigility-skeleton-0.7.0.zip","uploader":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbe5dfeb671c12d7520445b9292e10d13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bda768a042bd034f3f8090401aa77935","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":104868699,"download_count":24,"created_at":"2013-11-15T22:54:27Z","updated_at":"2013-11-15T22:58:12Z"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/tarball/0.7.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/zipball/0.7.0","body":"Release
